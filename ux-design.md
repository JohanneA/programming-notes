#### [Jeff Gothelf - Workshop Lean UX au NUMA le 26/01/2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnPISc2aQFI)
We don't actually know if our system will be used the way we intended by users. The worst place to find out is when the app has been released. It's our responsibility as designers to ensure our programs have the highest probability of success.

**Vanity metrixs** Numbers that make you feel good about yourself but don't really tell you anything. Like launch numbers.
Doing market research can tell you if you actually have people interested in your service.

Software is continuous, we no longer have to wait for CD's with software on them. A continuous feedback loop is now possible. Allows sites to push updates and sense how well those updates are working by analyzing users behavior on the site

Key questions to ask:
* How long do we wait before we launch
* How do we define the right requirements for our products
* What signals are we looking for from the market (success criteria)

Requirements are assumptions, as in today's times they are guesses. So we need to do continuous learning to figure out what works and what doesn't. Instead of having requirements we *know* that works, we have requirements we *believe* that works. Which means testing something before building it to save time and resources.

##### Design thinking
> As a style of thinking, it is generally considered the ability to combine empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of insights and solutions, and rationality to analyze and fit solutions to context.
- Tim Brown, CEO & President, IDEO

##### Lean UX
Prioritizing learning over growth. Do this by declaring all of the assumptions. At the very least:
* Who is the customer
* What problem are we trying to solve for the customer
* What solution do we think will work
* What outcome is the customer seeking
* How are we going to get customers
* Who will be our first customers
* What's our business model
* Who's our competition
* What makes us better than the competition

Turn these into hypothesis:

 "We believe that
 [building this feature]
 [for these people]
 will achieve [this outcome]"

 "We will know we are successful when we see [this signal from the market]" <-- This is when you're done

 The purpose of those statements is to create a debate about the product instead of a set in stone requirement.

 Talking to customers to discover if there is a need for your solution and run light weight tests to validate the need. Compare these test results to explicitly defined outcomes of success.

 This changes the measure of progress from output to outcome. Where outcome is a measureable change in customer behavior attributable to specific output. Now, works as designed is no longer good enough. You need to continuously talk to your customers as you can launch as many features as you want, but they can still suck.

 Therefore, make decisions based on objective observations.

From your test result you have three options:
 * Kill it if the results show it's not working
 * Pivot if it seems like you're going somewhere but not fast enough. (So keep the idea but change the strategy)
 * Double down if you're getting the results that you want

The easy parts of Lean UX are, measuring, talking to customers, pausing and reflecting. Changing course is the hard part.

Mitigating risk by not building things customers don't want.

Lean UX and Design thinking is not just for designers, but it can help teams overall, i.e.
 * Bring perspective to the product definition process from all disciplines
 * Posses increased empathy for the user
 * Understand the why behind every initiative
 * Learn more, faster, by sharing the discovery and creation process.
 * Realize that people have more competencies than just their job title

##### Funding Lean UX projects
Funded incrementally.

Measure success based on progress made towards outcomes.
