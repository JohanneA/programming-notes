# Functional programming

### Functional programming vs. imperative programming:
In imperative programming, a program can change states, as in you have global variables you can change the value of. You tell do program what to do.

In functional programming, variables cannot change and you tell the computer what stuff is rather than how to do something. This also means functions have no *side effects* (they don't change anything outside of the scope of the function).
* A function only calculates and returns a value. These values can be stored if the inputs are repeated often to speed up programs.
* Recursion is used over loops
